 <h3>Design</h3><br>
 <p>
 I am a graphic designer, interested in web design, photo manipulation, gif design, logo design and photo retouching.

This portfolio contains all the things that I have created. In my gallery I will show some of the assets I have 
used in creating my work and the process so you can see how I work.

The applications I use are Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, After Effects and Xd for graphic design, gifs, 
photo manipulation and other designs.

I also use Brackets for coding and 3DS Max for 3D modelling.<br><br> 

I have a collection of font icons here under “IAcons” which can easily be linked into your HTML and used
by writing the class of the font into a “span” element or by inserting it via CSS, more infomation
on the IAcons page.<br><br>

I have a really strong understanding of HTML and CSS, my understanding of JQuery is 
very basic though I still manage to get by with simple Ui functions.  
     
I have also created a few themes for people to use on Tumblr I have also completed a couple of 
commissions for people on Tumblr too which can be downloaded for free.

I also have own my own Tumblr page with a large following where I showcase the original art work and 
photography of creators on Tumblr to provide them a platform to grow.<br><br>
     
Self-reliance is really important to me, so I try to learn and cover as many skills as possible
so that I can get more done and understand the creative process of multiple different aspects of design.<br><br>

I find a lot of areas of design fascinating which is why I like to cover so many areas.<br><br>

<h3>Music</h3><br>
<p>
 In 1999 two weeks before my 7th birthday my parents bought me a drum kit after a lot of my pleading  and demonstrating that I was willing to take up drumming.<br><br>

 After a couple of little lessons from my father and a few years of practice I played my first live performance in a pub when I was 9 and from then on played as a volunteer drummer for the local country music club. Throughout my life I played live gigs, taught and got people through their HSC exams.<br><br>
    
 I attended Picton High School and was forced into the school band and whilst still being a juniour at age 13 I was put into the senior band and made the "head drummer", I was no fan of the school band but put up with it until I left after getting my year 10 certificate. During high school I was sometimes pulled out of class to help senior students get through their HSC exams by being part of their musical ensemble.<br><br>
    
 I got my first teaching gig in 2009 at a place in Narellan called The Drum Room Network and taught there until I left in 2011. I have always been complimented on my ability to improvise and think on the spot, especially when it comes to learning songs as I just need to listen to them and know how to play them, reading isn't my strong point when it comes to music, everything comes down to feel with me.
